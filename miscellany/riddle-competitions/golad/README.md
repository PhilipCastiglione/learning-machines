TODO:
 - document
 - node - birth
 - logging
 - bot - build tree for NON NAIVE
 - game - timing
 - next state - build and run generator for the possible sets of strings for each type (each corners, sides, normal cell)
 - use frontier rather than resetting graph progress every time
 - improve heuristic; consider more than just gap? tile positions?
 - lib structure
 - confirm garbage collection on nodes works as expected
