# Optimisation

Placeholder

## Genetic Algorithms

algo params:

- intialization (random vs heuristic)
- population model
- parent selection
- crossover
- mutation
- survivor selection
- lifetime adaptation model
- number of generations
- termination condition

## Problem Domains
1. titanic survivor prediction (optimisiing prediction factors)

## TODO
- README
- driver needs to handle input for hyperparams (maybe also algo params?)
- documentation
- there is a bug in the GA where occasionally it goes into a downward spiral?
- output/reporting
- more optimisation algos (GAs can use different approachs for lots of steps)
- more problem domains
