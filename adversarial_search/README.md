# Adversarial Search
Adversarial search is used in multi-agent competitive situations. Adverarial
search is a topic used in Artificial Intelligence to hone algorithms and
techniques that are robust enough to work in situations where the active agent
is not in complete control of the environment, due to both the actions of
external agents and chance.

algos:

1. naive minimax
1. minimax with heuristic utlity evaluation function and depth limit
1. minimax with alpha-beta pruning and utility evaluation
1. expectiminimax

problem ideas, use libs and write a wrapper ideally:

tic tac toe
chess
checkers
backgammon (for stochastic)
