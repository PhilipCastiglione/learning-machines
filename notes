BFS - Breadth First Search
DFS - Depth First Search
LDFS - Limited-Depth Depth First Search
IDFS - Iterative Deepening Depth First Search
Uniform-Cost Search
Greedy Breadth with heuristic ?? or just Greedy best first actually
Greedy Depth with heuristic
A* - A-Star Search
IDA* - IDA-Star Search
DA - Dijkstra's Algorithm


Need a problem type with non uniform cost
for UCS example 

rename ids and lds
